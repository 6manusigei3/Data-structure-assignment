## Programming Language
Python

## Objective
To demonstrate the classification of data structures and their applications using code and research.

## Data Structure Classification

### 1. Primitive Data Structures
- Integer
- Float
- Character
- Boolean

### 2. Non-primitive Data Structures

#### Linear Data Structures
- Array
- Linked List
- Stack
- Queue

#### Non-Linear Data Structures
- Tree
- Graph

## Algorithms
- Sorting (Bubble Sort)
- Searching (Linear Search)

## Project Structure
- `code/` contains all Python implementations
- `research/` contains applications, reasons, and system usage

## How to Run
Open any file in the `code` folder and run:
