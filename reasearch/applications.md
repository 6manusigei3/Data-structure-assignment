# Applications of Data Structures and Algorithms

## 1. Array
Arrays are used to store collections of data in a fixed-size structure with fast access using index values.

Applications:
- Image processing systems
- Spreadsheets such as Microsoft Excel
- Storing student marks in school systems

Reason:
Arrays allow quick retrieval of elements using index positions, making them efficient for simple data storage.

## 2. Linked List
Linked lists are used where dynamic memory allocation is required.

Applications:
- Music and video playlists
- Undo and redo operations in text editors
- Browser navigation (back and forward)

Reason:
Linked lists can grow or shrink easily without wasting memory.

---

## 3. Stack
Stacks follow the Last In First Out (LIFO) principle.

Applications:
- Browser back button
- Function calls in programming languages
- Expression evaluation in compilers

Reason:
Stacks manage temporary data efficiently and maintain order of execution.

## 4. Queue
Queues follow the First In First Out (FIFO) principle.

Applications:
- Printer job scheduling
- Customer service systems
- CPU process scheduling

Reason:
Queues ensure tasks are processed in the order they arrive.

## 5. Tree
Trees organize data hierarchically.

Applications:
- File systems (folders and subfolders)
- Database indexing
- XML and HTML document structure

Reason:
Trees allow fast searching and organized storage of hierarchical data.

---

## 6. Graph
Graphs represent relationships between data elements.

Applications:
- Social media networks
- Google Maps navigation
- Network routing systems

Reason:
Graphs efficiently model real-world relationships and paths.

## 7. Hash Table
Hash tables store data in key-value pairs.

Applications:
- Password storage
- Caching systems
- Dictionaries in programming languages

Reason:
Hash tables provide very fast data retrieval.
